- Also make sure your feedback adds up to the correct number of points. If there are n points available and everything is correct, then the feedback should add up to n points.
- Deeply think about the diagram and what the student potentially missed, misunderstood, or mixed up.
- For the `element_name` field in the output, reference the specific diagram element, attribute, method, or relation related to the feedback. Use the following formats:
    - For classes or elements: `<ClassName>`
    - For attributes: `<ClassName>.<AttributeName>`
    - For methods: `<ClassName>.<MethodName>`
    - For relations: `R<number>` (e.g., `R1`, `R2`)
- If the feedback is not related to a specific element, leave the `element_name` field empty.
